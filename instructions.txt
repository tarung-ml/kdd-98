| EXERCISE OVERVIEW: A Fund Raising Revenue Prediction Model         | 
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

This problem is meant to evaluate the user’s approach and strategies
in developing a predictive model in a high dimensional setting. Please document
your analysis and model creation process thoroughly. A clear description of your
thought process and reasoning for each step of your work is much more valuable
than the results predicted on the testing set (although a good working
model is obviously a plus). You can use software or libraries
of your choice as long as your thought process is clearly and thoroughly
documented.

This is a high dimensional problem with features that may appear obscure
or unclear to the user. Part of the challenge of this task is extract
valuable features when the meaning of the individual features is unclear or
its unwieldy to individually evaluate each one.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
-------------------------

The data set for this exercise are the results of a fundraising effort. Requests
for donations to aid US veterans were mailed (referred to as 97NK mailing) to a large set of people
who have donated to a similar cause in the past.

The data set for this exercise includes a large number of features
about the set of people who were mailed a request as well as two response variables called
‘Target_B’ and ‘Target_D’. ‘Target_A’ refers to whether the member responded to the request.
‘Target_D’ is the dollar amount of the member’s donation if the user donated.

Your goal is build a model that can improve the cost-effectiveness of future direct
marketing effort by maximizing the net revenue (a regression or estimation task) generated
from mailing another set of donation requests.

The training and testing files include 191,779 donors who received the
mailing, with responders to the mailing marked with a flag in the
TARGET_B field.  The total dollar amount of each responder's gift is
in the TARGET_D field.

The overall response rate for this direct mail promotion is 5.1%.  The
distribution of the target fields in the learning files
is as follows:

There are two separate pieces to the submission. The first is the code
along with documentation describing your analysis and model 
building process. The other is a file containing predictions on the
testing set. Each prediction should be a line with the unique record
identifier (field name: CONTROLN) along with the prediction value. The
code along with a documentation of your thought process is more
important than the prediction file.

The objective of the analysis will be to maximize the net
revenue generated from the mailed promotions according to the testing set.
The response variable is, thus, continuous (for 
the lack of a better common term.) Although we are releasing both the
binary and the continuous versions of the target variable (TARGET_B
and TARGET_D respectively), the
predicted value of the donation (dollar) amount (for the target
variable TARGET_D) will be used for evaluating the results. So, returning the
predicted value of the binary target variable TARGET_B and its
associated probability/strength will not be sufficient. 

The typical outcome of predictive modeling in database marketing is 
an estimate of the expected response/return per customer in the
database. A marketer will mail to a customer so long as the expected 
return from an order exceeds the cost invested in generating the order, 
i.e., the cost of promotion. For our purpose, the package cost 
(including the mail cost) is $0.68 per piece mailed.

The evaluation of the results will be based solely on the net
revenue generated on the hold-out or validation sample.

The measure we will use is:

  Sum (the actual donation amount - $0.68) over all records for 
  which the expected revenue (or predicted value of the donation) 
  is over $0.68.

This is a direct measure of profit.

1. This data set contains a large number of features. Part of the challenge
is finding ways to deal with a large numbers of features which you might
not know the meaning of.

2. Some of the fields in the analysis file may contain data entry and/or
formatting errors. Cleaning the data is not the purpose of this exercise.
We are more interested in your approach to the overall problem than the
actual performance of your model, so don’t spend much time cleaning
data even if you think it will hurt your model’s performance.


3. The data sets are in comma delimited format. The learning dataset
<train_set> contains 95412 records and 481 fields. The first/header
row of the data set contains the field names.

The validation dataset <testing_set> contains 96367 records and 479
variables. The first/header row of the data set contains the field
names.

THE RECORDS IN THE VALIDATION DATASET ARE IDENTICAL TO THE RECORDS IN
THE LEARNING DATASET EXCEPT THAT THE VALUES FOR THE TARGET/DEPENDENT
VARIABLES ARE MISSING (i.e., the fields TARGET_B and TARGET_D are
not included in the validation data set.)

4. The data dictionary (for both the learning and the validation data
set) is included in the file <data_details>. The fields in the data
dictionary are ordered by the position of the fields in the learning
data set. The dictionary for the validation data set is identical to
the dictionary for the learning data set except the two target fields
(target_B and target_D) are missing in the validation data set.

5. Blanks in the string (or character) variables/fields and periods in
the numeric variables correspond to missing values.

6. Each record has a unique record identifier or index (field name:
CONTROLN.) For each record, there are two target/dependent variables
(field names: TARGET_B and TARGET_D). TARGET_B is a binary variable
indicating whether or not the record responded to the promotion of
interest ("97NK" mailing) while TARGET_D contains the donation amount
(dollar) and is only observed for those that responded to the
promotion. Neither of these should be used to train the model.

Each record in the returned file should consist of the following two
values:

a. The unique record identifier or index (field name: CONTROLN)
b. Predicted value of the donation (dollar) amount (for the target
variable TARGET_D) for that record

| DATA SOURCES and ORDER & TYPE OF THE VARIABLES IN THE DATA SETS    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

The dataset includes:

o 24 months of detailed promotion and giving history (covering the
  period 12 to 36 months prior to the "97NK" mailing)

o A summary of the promotions sent to the donors over the most recent
  12 months prior to the "97NK" mailing (none of these
  donors responded to any of these promotions)

o Summary variables reflecting each donor's lifetime giving history
  (e.g., total # of donations prior to "97NK" mailing, total $ amount
  of the donations, etc.)

o Overlay demographics, including a mix of household and area level
  data

o All other available data (e.g., date of first
  gift, state, origin source, etc.)

The fields are described in greater detail in the data_details file.
